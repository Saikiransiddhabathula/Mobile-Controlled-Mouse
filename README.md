# **Mobile-Controlled-Mouse**
The purpose of this project titled “Mobile-Controlled Mouse”  is to solve the problems that raise while using normal optical/laser mouse like breakdown of wire, the optical eye may be blocked.
This can be controlled right away with your smartphone with an application built using MIT app inventor.
Which neither require any subscription to use it nor any internet connection. 

## **Abstract**
Since the interior of the mouse is dirty, an optical-mechanical mouse (mouse with a ball) can not function properly.
The optical eye can be blocked if the optical mouse (LED or laser) exhibits abnormal activity.
Hair or fuzz will obstruct the optical sensor on the mouse's foot, causing it to malfunction.
We still have to deal with other issues with mice, such as wire breakage and wireles. 

As a result, my Mobile-Controlled mouse can assist in manipulating laptop or computer screens through a smartphone application.
I'm using a smartphone as a mouse to monitor the displays of a laptop or computer.
This mouse can do everything a normal mouse can do, including scrolling, left and right clicking, and moving the cursor.
